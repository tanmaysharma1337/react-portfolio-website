      I got into programming out of sheer curiosity—I just wanted to know how things worked behind the scenes in the digital world.
      What started as a simple interest quickly turned into something I absolutely love.
      There's nothing quite like the feeling of bringing an idea to life through code. Every project I work on, every challenge I solve, just deepens my passion for it.
      Programming isn’t just a skill for me; it’s something I genuinely enjoy, and I’m always excited to see where it takes me next.
