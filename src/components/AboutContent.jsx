        <p style={{width:"40%"}}>If I had to sum myself up in one word, it would be "curious" .Ever since I can remember,  
        I've been fascinated by how things work and how to make them better. That's what drew me to programming.  
        It's like being handed a magic wand that lets you bring your ideas to life, whether it's creating a game, a website, or a tool to solve a problem.  
        I love the creativity it allows, the way you can build something from scratch and watch it evolve into something amazing.  
        It's not just about typing lines of code; it's about crafting solutions and making a tangible impact.  
        Programming is my playground, my canvas, and my passion.  
        It's where I feel most alive, exploring endless possibilities and constantly learning something new.  
        And that's why I'm here, ready to dive into the next adventure and see where it takes me. </p>
