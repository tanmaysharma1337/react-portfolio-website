        Apart from programming , I also love playing games ,Gaming has been my
        passion since I can remember. I've not only played games for fun but
        also competed at a national level as an e-sports athlete (yeah thats
        what you call them) in Valorant and PUBG PC.

        Gaming has always been a big part of my life, but it wasnâ€™t long before I wondered, "What goes into making these worlds come alive?"
        That question drew me into game development, where I found the joy of combining creativity and technical skills to build experiences for others.
